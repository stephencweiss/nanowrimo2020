# Chapter 1

The house looked just like he remembered it, though perhaps a little more worn. Even the tire swing was exactly where he'd left it, swinging gently in the autumn breeze. The leaves on the maple, the same one he and Patrick had hung that swing from when they were kids, when they were still best friends, had turned a brilliant red. How long had it been since he'd been home - or spoken to Patrick for that matter? Ten years at least. Probably more.

He parked the rental car in the driveway, grabbed his overnight bag from the backseat and got out. With any luck, this would be a short trip. Really, it needed to be. He'd assured Alexa that he'd be back in a day or two - there had to be a explanation and Amy was probably overreacting, after all, he'd reasoned, if there was actually a problem, the police would be involved - and when he got home they would talk through everything.

Amy must have heard the tires spinning on the loose gravel because when he looked up she was standing in the doorway. Under different circumstances she would have smiled. Meanwhile, his failure to suppress a smile despite the circumstances only served as further evidence that she'd always been the most disciplined sibling. He couldn't help it. Hers was the first friendly face he'd seen in weeks. His shoulders, which he hadn't noticed he'd been clenching, relaxed at the sight of her. He dropped the duffel on the threshold and pulled her close, enveloping her slight frame in his massive arms, "How you doing, kid?"

She'd refused to let herself relax since she first called the police to report that their father was missing. In her brother's arms, however, her body no longer seemed to listen and she let out a small sigh, "It's so good to see you J.J. Thank you for coming."

"Of course. Let's get out of the cold and you can catch me up on what's going on."

It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the light - or lack there of. No one had bothered to turn any lights on in the living room, so the only light was the little that managed to sneak past the tightly drawn curtains. His hand instinctively reached for the switch on the wall, but no lights came on.

"Burnt out."

"Huh, strange. I know dad's always been mostly useless around the house, but to let all of the lights burn out and not change them feels... well, it feels unusual. The dust on the other hand - that's no surprise." Every horizontal surface was caked with dust. That's how it'd been ever since mom had passed - or would have been had it not been for Patrick, Amy, and him. Patrick had moved to New York years ago, and he hadn't stepped foot in the house for even longer, so taking care of dad had fallen on Amy - not that she didn't have plenty on her plate as it is.

"Yeah, he's been even more _himself_ of late. Working all the time. It's been all I can do to get him to come over for Sunday dinner with me and Beau." Dad had always been a workaholic. Growing up he'd stay at the lab until well after the family had sat down for dinner. When he did finally get home, he'd head straight to his study, where he'd pour himself a whisky and light a cigar to bury himself in more work, but only after closing the big oak door.

A light came on in the hallway, not all of them had burnt out apparently, and a few seconds and several footsteps later, Patrick stepped into view. Backlit from the hall light, his features were obscured, but, even after years of not seeing him or hearing his voice, there was no doubt who was standing in the doorway.

"Amy said you'd come. I wasn't so sure."

"Pat, please!"

"No, no, it's alright." He said as reassuringly as he could to Amy before turning to face his little brother's outline, "I can't say I wasn't wondering the same about you."

"Ha - I'm not the one who swore I'd never step foot in this house again!"

"Guys! Now's not the time to get into a pissing match about something that happened over a decade ago! You can duke it out after we find dad. Until then, try to act like the grown men you are. For me. For dad."

"Fine by me. Sorry Amy. Pat?" A grunt emanated from the outline in the doorway which he decided to interpret as assent. "What do we know so far?"

## Chapter 3

Amy led them into the kitchen which at least had working lights and less dust, and outlined what she'd been able to piece together. It wasn't much.
