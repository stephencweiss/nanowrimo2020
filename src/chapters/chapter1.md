# Chapter 1

The house looked just like he remembered it, though perhaps a little more worn. Even the tire swing was exactly where he'd left it, swinging gently in the autumn breeze. The leaves on the maple, the same one he and Patrick had hung that swing from when they were kids, when they were still best friends, had turned a brilliant red. How long had it been since he'd been home - or spoken to Patrick for that matter? Ten years at least. Probably more.

He parked the rental car in the driveway, grabbed his overnight bag from the backseat and got out. With any luck, this would be a short trip. Really, it needed to be. He'd assured Alexa that he'd be back in a day or two - there had to be a explanation and Amy was probably overreacting, after all, he'd reasoned, if there was actually a problem, the police would be involved - and when he got home they would talk through everything.

Amy must have heard the tires spinning on the loose gravel because when he looked up she was standing in the doorway. As the smile spread across his face, hers was the first friendly one he'd seen in weeks, he called out across the yard, "How you doing, kid?"

Getting closer, he pulled her in for a hug - but not before he ruffled her hair like he used to when they were kids which earned him a smile and a small laugh. "It's good to see you J.J. - though I wish the reason were happier."

"Agreed. Now let's get out of the cold and you can catch me up."

# Chapter 2

"Is the whole house like this?" A plume of dust had risen up when he dropped the duffel in the living room and all but one of the lights in the living room seemed to have burnt out, so the siblings were standing in darkness, illuminated only by the little light that managed to sneak past the curtains.

"No. The back of the house is better - or at least livable. I'd been trying to get Dad to let me have someone come out to help him but he always refused." Sounded like Dad. Mom had been the one who made sure the house ran on time and was clean. After she'd passed, the kids had tried to pick up the slack when it became clear Dad wouldn't, but one by one they all left town and only Amy had returned to even try to help. "Come on, I have water on the stove. I'll make some coffee and we can chat."

He followed her through the maze that was the living room. Stepping over piles of books strewn about the floor and trying to avoid brushing any horizontal, and many vertical surfaces, all caked with dust.

"We should at least open a window and let some air circulate."

She shrugged unenthusiastically, "Eh, you get used to it and it's not so bad in the back. Besides, you know how the neighbors are."

"Yeah, he's been even more _himself_ of late. Working all the time. It's been all I can do to get him to come over for Sunday dinner with me and Beau." Dad had always been a workaholic. Growing up he'd stay at the lab until well after the family had sat down for dinner. When he did finally get home, he'd head straight to his study, where he'd pour himself a whisky and light a cigar to bury himself in more work, but only after closing the big oak door.

A light came on in the hallway, not all of them had burnt out apparently, and a few seconds and several footsteps later, Patrick stepped into view. Backlit from the hall light, his features were obscured, but, even after years of not seeing him or hearing his voice, there was no doubt who was standing in the doorway.

"Amy said you'd come. I wasn't so sure."

"Pat, please!"

"No, no, it's alright." He said as reassuringly as he could to Amy before turning to face his little brother's outline, "I can't say I wasn't wondering the same about you."

"Ha - I'm not the one who swore I'd never step foot in this house again!"

"Guys! Now's not the time to get into a pissing match about something that happened over a decade ago! You can duke it out after we find dad. Until then, try to act like the grown men you are. For me. For dad."

"Fine by me. Sorry Amy. Pat?" A grunt emanated from the outline in the doorway which he decided to interpret as assent. "What do we know so far?"

## Chapter 3

Amy led them into the kitchen which at least had working lights and less dust, and outlined what she'd been able to piece together. It wasn't much.
