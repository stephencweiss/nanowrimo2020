# Chapter 1

The house looked just like John remembered it, though a little more worn. The tire he and Patrick had hung from the branch of the maple when they were kids, when they were still best friends, was swinging gently in the breeze. How long had it been since he'd been home - or spoken to Patrick for that matter? Ten years at least. Probably more.

John parked in the driveway, grabbed his overnight bag from the backseat - he'd assured Alexa that the trip would only be a day or two and when he got back they could talk through everything - and got out of the car.

Amy must have heard the tires spinning on the loose gravel because when John looked up she was standing in the doorway. Under different circumstances she would have smiled. John failed to suppress his own smile which crept into the corners of his lips and inched them upwards as he neared the door. Hers was the first friendly face he'd seen in what seemed like weeks. He pulled the door open, dropped his duffel on the threshold and enveloped her slight frame in his massive arms, "How you doing kid?"

Her body responded reflexively by sagging. Safe and secure in her big brother's arms, it rebelled by relaxing, something she'd not allowed herself since she'd first called the police to report their father was missing.
