# Chapter 1

The house looked just like he remembered it, though perhaps a little more worn. Even the tire swing was exactly where he'd left it, swinging gently in the autumn breeze. The leaves on the maple, the same one he and Patrick had hung that swing from when they were kids, when they were still best friends, had turned a brilliant red. How long had it been since he'd been home - or spoken to Patrick for that matter? Ten years at least. Probably more.

He parked the rental car in the driveway, grabbed his overnight bag from the backseat and got out. With any luck, this would be a short trip. Really, it needed to be. He'd assured Alexa that he'd be back in a day or two - there had to be a explanation and Amy was probably overreacting, after all, he'd reasoned, if there was actually a problem, the police would be involved - and when he got home they would talk through everything.

Amy must have heard the tires spinning on the loose gravel because when he looked up she was standing in the doorway. Under different circumstances she would have smiled. Meanwhile, his failure to suppress a smile despite the circumstances only served as further evidence that she'd always been the most disciplined sibling. He couldn't help it. Hers was the first friendly face he'd seen in weeks. His shoulders, which he hadn't noticed he'd been clenching, relaxed at the sight of her. He dropped the duffel on the threshold and pulled her close, enveloping her slight frame in his massive arms, "How you doing, kid?"

She'd refused to let herself relax since she first called the police to report that their father was missing. In her brother's arms, however, her body no longer seemed to listen and she let out a small sigh, "It's so good to see you J.J. Thank you for coming."

"Of course. Let's get out of the cold and you can catch me up on what's going on."

# Chapter 2

John released Amy from his grasp and they went inside the house. The shades are drawn and there's a definite musk in the air. Even the layer of dust blanketing every horizontal surface were no surprise - dad had always been useless around the house. When mom was alive, she'd made sure the house ran on time, and after she'd passed, the responsibility passed to the kids. Dad just worked all the time. Most of the time he was down at the lab, not getting home until well after dinner, but even on the nights when he got home early he wasn't around. Instead, he'd go straight to his office where he'd close the door, light a cigar, and bury himself in more work.
