General plot notes

# background

three siblings, two brothers and a sister return to their childhood home upon the news that their father passed away. (the mother passed away years ago and none of the children have been hom since - their father was the type who was never around and had never forged a relationship with any of his children -- his daughter, the youngest of the three being the only one who had continued to try, albeit from a distance).

## characters

**John Sr.** - deceased
formerly a chemist at Acme labs, a front company for the CIA. his research focused on nanotechnologies. he was unceremoniously "retired" from the agency after his wife died and he became obsessed with developing a process of using nanotechnologies to reverse the decay of human cells, even after death. he continued his research after leaving the agency, but the closer he got to what he believed was a solution, the more paranoid he became that he was being watched.

**John** - eldest
forensic accountant. He's the "serious" brother. very business like. he's also going through a lot of personal problems at home that he's keeping to himself (his wife is leaving him and taking their daughter). His firm, the one he started, is also struggling and he's losing a big client. his life is falling apart, though he hasn't acknowledged that yet, and he's trying to keep everything together - at least from the outside, so far there are few cracks to be seen. he is living on the other side of the country (e.g., LA)

**Patrick** - Middle
more of an artist - currently working in marketing for a large agency, his primary client is a large multi-national food company (e.g., General Mills). He had big dreams when he moved to new york, but he's struggled with drugs and alcohol over the years, though he's been sober for the last few. he's been working on a screen play for years, but doesn't seem capable of finishing it. his story is a trail of half-finished projects.

**Amy** - youngest
the glue for the family. after mom passed away, she moved back to town to be near dad and keep an eye on him - though he remained stubborn and didn't really allow her into his life. she reconnected with her high school boyfriend who'd moved back after college to take over his family business - construction (he doesn't talk much about the business, it's likely not very legitimate and has refused her offer to introduce him to her brother). she's a hematologist at the local hospital.
