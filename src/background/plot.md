General plot notes

# background

three siblings, two brothers and a sister return to their childhood home upon the news that their father passed away. (the mother passed away years ago and none of the children have been hom since - their father was the type who was never around and had never forged a relationship with any of his children -- his daughter, the youngest of the three being the only one who had continued to try, albeit from a distance).

what begins as a normal reunion of an estranged family turns a race against time as the siblings must learn to work together to find out what really happened to their father and find his research before his killers can - discovering along the way that family isn't always what you think, but it's the one thing you can count on.

## characters

**John Sr.** - deceased
formerly a chemist at Acme labs, a front company for the CIA. his research focused on nanotechnologies. he was unceremoniously "retired" from the agency after his wife died and he became obsessed with developing a process of using nanotechnologies to reverse the decay of human cells, even after death - though it would have to be administered quickly, before too much decomposition occurred to destroy the foundation. he continued his research after leaving the agency, but the closer he got to what he believed was a solution, the more paranoid he became that he was being watched. this resulted in writing more and more of his work in code and hiding critical pieces outside of his home with trusted associates and in lock boxes / security deposit boxes, etc.

**John** - eldest
forensic accountant. He's the "serious" brother. very business like. he's also going through a lot of personal problems at home that he's keeping to himself (his wife is leaving him and taking their daughter). His firm, the one he started, is also struggling and he's losing a big client. his life is falling apart, though he hasn't acknowledged that yet, and he's trying to keep everything together - at least from the outside, so far there are few cracks to be seen. he is living on the other side of the country (e.g., LA). John's biggest hope is that he finds a solution to his family woes.

**Patrick** - Middle
more of an artist - currently working in marketing for a large agency, his primary client is a large multi-national food company (e.g., General Mills). He had big dreams when he moved to new york, but he's struggled with drugs and alcohol over the years, though he's been sober for the last few. he's been working on a screen play for years, but doesn't seem capable of finishing it. his story is a trail of half-finished projects. patrick's biggest hope is to understand what happened to their dad, because he's convinced that it wasn't a natural death

**Amy** - youngest
the glue for the family. after mom passed away, she moved back to town to be near dad and keep an eye on him - though he remained stubborn and didn't really allow her into his life. she reconnected with her high school boyfriend who'd moved back after college to take over his family business - construction (he doesn't talk much about the business, it's likely not very legitimate and has refused her offer to introduce him to her brother). she's a hematologist at the local hospital. amy's biggest hope is that her brothers will reconcile and they'll be a family again.

# Plot points

1. father's death was sudden and caught the children off guard - they all descend on their childhood home to clear up the affairs. it's the first time they've seen one another in several years
1. john tries to assume control of the financial affairs - he's hopeful that the inheritance can buy him some time to save his company. amy mentions the lawyer is coming to read the will later today. patrick meanwhile is rummaging through all of the papers that dad left.
1. patrick finds dad's notebooks and shares them with the siblings. together they try to piece together what dad was getting on about. john doesn't see the point - saying it's a waste of time and goes back to digging through the bank statements to find the money. amy's the best chance they have to actually understanding what dad was trying to do.
1. the lawyer arrives and reads the will ... anything happen here?
1. within dad's papers, patrick finds references to a dr. williams. he assumes he's an old colleague of dad's from Acme, but it seems like they've continued to work together. patrick contacts williams, who quickly hangs up once patrick identifies himself.
1. patrick and amy track williams down and confront him outside of a coffee shop. williams is clearly terrified and tries to leave - tells them to drop it and stop looking into their father's research. redoubling their effort, they return to their father's research, certain now that they've missed something and that their father was onto something big.
1. meanwhile, CIA agents who have been watching Williams notice the call from John's house and the confrontation outside of the coffee shop and pick up Williams (this may all be off screen...)
1. john finds accounts that make no sense for their father - at least not the father he thought he had. john sr. had shell corporations upon shell corporations creating a vast network of interrelated entities - the type of thing john jr. was used to with the Kleiner account - his largest client, the one who was leaving him, and certainly one who was operating outside of the law. he asks patrick or amy if they have any idea why their dad would have the accounts without revealing the full extent of the mystery (e.g., businesses in the caymans, etc.). he has to step away when his wife calls from their home in LA. It's a tense conversation and he hides it from his siblings.
1. Over pizza at the dining table they grew up with, the siblings reminisce about their childhood, though very few of the memories are happy. the memories of their father are all brief snippets - he played an offstage role in their lives. the realization leads to talking about their mother who played such a different role - always a shoulder, always available. Amy, who had several years after the brothers moved out to witness the two alone, commented that their mother was more active outside of the house than the brothers remembered. she always had a pta meeting or spent time at the food shelter, etc. (trying to introduce the idea that the mother was actually party to the research and these outings were reconnaissance often and her death was also not natural - though the children never deduce this)
1. patrick can't sleep. he returns to john sr.'s office and is reading the papers by lamp. amy joins. the papers refer to a lab at acme and some work done in the 80s. scene shifts to the lab in the 80s where we see john sr. as a young chemist, working alongside williams. this is before john even knows the mother, but it's the first time the reader get the sense that there was more to john's work at Acme than what the kids believed. john and williams' conversation talk about a new government program focused on creating applications on top of [feynman](https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/what/definition) principles of what Norio Taniguchi called "nanotechnologies". the program's stated aim was to have the ability to control individual atoms so that with a simple injection, the host would possess a fail switch by which a remote authority could hook into the body and direct activity. both men decide to volunteer to work on the project.
1. the next morning, john jr. is looking at more financial documents and notices that his father had a safety deposit box at first national which he opened a month before he died. he decides to drive down to investigate.
1. to be continued...
