General plot notes

# background

three siblings, two brothers and a sister return to their childhood home upon the news that their father's disappeared. (the mother's death years before had been a final straw for the family which had not been in the same room together since - their father was the type who was never around and had never forged a relationship with any of his children -- his daughter, the youngest of the three being the only one who had continued to try, albeit from a distance).

amy was the first one called because she's in town and John sr.'s dog was outside the front door barking to be let in for an hour before the neighbors called her.

what begins as an (ab)normal reunion of an estranged family turns into a race against time as the siblings learn to work together to find out what really happened to their father and what he was working on that seems the reason for his disappearance. Along the way they realize that family isn't always what you think, but it's the one thing you can count on.

## characters

**John Sr.** - deceased
formerly a chemist at Acme labs, a front company for the CIA. his research focused on nanotechnologies and the possibility to use them to reverse the decay of human cells, even after death. after several years, however, the project lost its funding and he was reassigned to a menial position in a lab working on project of no consequence. shortly afterwards, his wife died suddenly in a car accident that left her body unrecognizable (she was identified by dental records) and his life went into a tailspin. after her death, he retreated from his family even more becoming obsessed with cracking the code on the nanotechnology project. he worked in his home lab and collaborated with dr. williams. he felt he was nearing a breakthrough shortly before his disappearance. this belief that he was nearing a conclusion to years of research also increased his paranoia and his behavior became more and more erratic - which for the most part went unnoticed because he had long ago assumed the role of curmudgeon and senile neighbor.

**John** - eldest
forensic accountant. He's the "serious" brother. very business like. he was the golden child and the only one John Sr. spoke of with friends, but after the mother died, even their relationship frayed and John Jr. would ultimately go as far away as he could for college (UCLA) and after a blowout fight one thanksgiving (which is also when he and Patrick stopped talking), never return home. More recently, he's going through a lot of personal problems at home that he's keeping to himself (his wife is leaving him and taking their daughter). His firm, the one he started, is also struggling and he's losing the Kleiner account (his largest and most lucrative client). his life is falling apart, though he hasn't acknowledged that yet, and he's trying to keep everything together - at least from the outside, so far there are few cracks to be seen. he is living on the other side of the country (e.g., LA). John's biggest hope is that he finds a solution to his family woes, namely by finding the money he assumes his father has been stocking away.

**Patrick** - Middle
more of an artist - currently working in marketing for a large agency, his primary client is a large multi-national food company (e.g., General Mills). He had big dreams when he moved to new york, but he's struggled with drugs and alcohol over the years, though he's been sober for the last few. he's been working on a screen play for years, but doesn't seem capable of finishing it. his story is a trail of half-finished projects. of all the siblings, Patrick has the most active imagination, willing to see intrigue behind every corner. patrick's biggest hope is to understand what happened to their dad, because he's convinced that there has to be a story.

**Amy** - youngest
the glue for the family. even though john sr. never gave her the time of day, she was the one who always kept tabs on her brothers and an eye on their dad after mom passed away. even when she moved away for school, ultimately attending WashU St. Louis for Medical school and training in infectious disease. After training, she had the option to go anywhere, but wanted to come home to be near dad who she was getting more and more concerned about. though he didn't welcome her back with open arms, she was near enough to keep tabs on him. meanwhile, she reconnected with her high school boyfriend who'd also moved back after school to take over his family's construction business (he doesn't talk much about the business, it's likely not legitimate, and he's refused her offers to introduce him to John Jr. for accounting help.) after her father's disappearance, she was the one who called her brothers when the police declined to investigate suggesting that no crime had been committed. her biggest hope is that her brothers will reconcile (the disintegration of the family post-mom meant the brothers haven't talked directly in years) so that they can be a family again.

# Plot points

1. father's disappearance was sudden and caught the children off guard - the brothers fly into town all and descend on their childhood home. Amy's already there looking through the mess that is their father's house. it's the first time they've seen one another in several years
1. John Jr. tries to assume control of the situation so that he will have access to the financials (he's hopeful that the inheritance can buy him some time to save his company). Amy mentions she's contacted Dad's lawyer and he'll be stopping by later (JJ is frustrated by this as he wants to be point on all things related to money). Patrick, meanwhile, is rummaging through all of the papers that dad left.
1. Patrick finds dad's notebooks and shares them with the siblings. JJ isn't interested (saying it's a waste of time and goes back to digging through the bank statements to find the money), but Amy joins him. Together they try to piece together what dad was getting on about. Amy's medical training is their best chance they have to actually understanding what dad was trying to do, though even she is having a hard time with the work.
1. [PAST] some of the papers refer to a lab dad worked in at acme and some work done in the 80s. scene shifts to the lab in the 80s where we see john sr. as a young chemist, working alongside williams. this is before john even knows the mother, but the reader is introduced to a young, eager, and brilliant john sr. john and williams' talk about the emerging field of what Norio Taniguchi called "nanotechnologies" and discuss the lab's new project seeking to build practical applications on top of [feynman](https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/what/definition) principles. the program's stated aim was to enable control over individual atoms so that with a simple injection, the host would possess a fail switch by which a remote authority could hook into the body and direct activity. both men decide to volunteer to work on the project.
1. the lawyer arrives and speaks with the children. JJ takes him aside to talk about inheritance. it's awkward as it seems like JJ is only looking for money when it's not at all clear that their father is dead,
1. within dad's papers, patrick finds references to a dr. williams. he assumes he's an old colleague of dad's from Acme, but the dates don't make sense as they're much more recent. it seems like they've continued to work together. patrick attempts to contact williams, who quickly hangs up once patrick identifies himself.
1. patrick and amy track williams down and confront him outside of a coffee shop. williams is clearly terrified and tries to leave - tells them to drop it and stop looking into their father's research. redoubling their effort, they return to their father's research, certain now that they've missed something and that their father was onto something big.
1. [PAST] Scene about the stalling of the research and the shutting down of the project at Acme
1. meanwhile, CIA agents who have been watching Williams notice the call from John's house and the confrontation outside of the coffee shop and pick up Williams (this may all be off screen...)
1. john finds accounts that make no sense for their father - at least not the father he thought he had. john sr. had shell corporations upon shell corporations creating a vast network of interrelated entities - the type of thing john jr. was used to with the Kleiner account - his largest client, the one who was leaving him, and certainly one who was operating outside of the law. he asks patrick or amy if they have any idea why their dad would have the accounts without revealing the full extent of the mystery (e.g., businesses in the caymans, etc.). he has to step away when his wife calls from their home in LA. It's a tense conversation and he hides it from his siblings, but they notice he's unnerved when he returns.
1. Over pizza at the dining table they grew up with, the siblings reminisce about their childhood, though very few of the memories are happy. the memories of their father are all brief snippets - he played an offstage role in their lives. the realization leads to talking about their mother who played such a different role - always a shoulder, always available. Amy, though she was the youngest, was always the most observant and noted that mother was more active than the brothers seemed to remember. she was often out of the home - whether for pta meetings or volunteering at the food shelter, etc. (their mother was actually in the CIA, and when the project John Sr., was working on stalled and it seemed like they'd never have a solution, the agency decided to extract her from the deep cover assignment through a fake death. she initially resisted the new assignment. after a decade + she'd forged a family and it would mean losing contact with her children (JJ now being 10, Patrick 8, and Amy 6) but ultimately acquiesced and was reassigned back to langley. -- readers do not know this)
1. [PAST] Mom dies, dad's life unravels
1. the next morning, john jr. is looking at more financial documents and notices a few odd transactions: a. his father placed an ad in the local gazette in may (though he's always been a tribune man) .
1. to be continued...

1. [PAST] John sr. has second thoughts on whether or not the research should be finished - the technology, in the wrong hands, could wreak havoc on the world. williams urges him to reconsider.

1. [PAST]

thoughts:
john sr. "solved" the problem only to realize that it would be a disaster. he tries to destroy the research, but williams kills him.
williams then, "plays the victim" to try to turn the kids off the hunt initially. he'll show up later in a more authoritative way to try to silence them... but fails

john sr. is killed on the eve of a breakthrough - even as he's starting to have second thoughts about the research (perhaps the idea that he's "obsessed with reviving the dead" is actually misdirection on the part of the CIA who use it as a pretense to get him out of the picture so they can carry on with the research).
then, when the kids realize what's going on, and have proof from the safety deposit box (+ others), they're able to reveal the plot to the public and send the CIA into cover up territory where they begin to hide all of their tracks - but can't touch the kids because they're too public now
