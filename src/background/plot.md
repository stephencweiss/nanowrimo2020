three siblings, two brothers and a sister return home when their father disappeared. what begins as an (ab)normal reunion of an estranged family turns into a race against time as the siblings learn to work together to find out what really happened to their father and what he was working on that seems the reason for his disappearance. along the way they realize that family isn't always what you think, but it's the one thing you can count on.

## a little color

three siblings, two brothers and a sister return to their childhood home upon the news that their father's disappeared. (the mother's death years before had been a final straw for the family which had not been in the same room together since - their father was the type who was never around, a workaholic, and had never forged a relationship with any of his children -- his daughter, the youngest of the three being the only one who had continued to try, albeit from a distance).

amy was the first one called because she's in town and John sr.'s dog was outside the front door barking to be let in for an hour before the neighbors called her.

# Plot points

1. prelude: a scene of john sr. working late when he's interrupted. it appears to be someone he knows and they talk for a few minutes about where his research is - where the actual product is. when john sr. doesn't tell, he's hit over the head. when he is knocked out, the scene ends.
1. father's disappearance was sudden and caught the children off guard - the brothers fly into town all and descend on their childhood home. Amy's already there looking through the mess that is their father's house. it's the first time they've seen one another in several years. she tells them what she knows - that dad's disappeared, the police won't investigate. (it's fall - just from a seasonal/backdrop perspective)
1. John Jr. tries to assume control of the situation so that he will have access to the financials (he's hopeful that the inheritance can buy him some time to save his company). Amy mentions she's contacted Dad's lawyer and he'll be stopping by later (JJ is frustrated by this as he wants to be point on all things related to money). Patrick, meanwhile, is rummaging through all of the papers that dad left.
1. Patrick finds dad's notebooks and shares them with the siblings. JJ isn't interested (saying it's a waste of time and goes back to digging through the bank statements to find the money), but Amy joins him. Together they try to piece together what dad was getting on about. Amy's medical training is their best chance they have to actually understanding what dad was trying to do, though even she is having a hard time with the work.
1. [PAST] some of the papers refer to a lab dad worked in at acme and some work done in the 80s. scene shifts to the lab in the 80s where we see john sr. as a young chemist, working alongside williams. this is before john even knows the mother, but the reader is introduced to a young, eager, and brilliant john sr. john and williams' talk about the emerging field of what Norio Taniguchi called "nanotechnologies" and discuss the lab's new project seeking to build practical applications on top of [feynman](https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/what/definition) principles. the program's stated aim was to enable control over individual atoms so that with a simple injection, the host would possess a fail switch by which a remote authority could hook into the body and direct activity. both men decide to volunteer to work on the project.
1. the lawyer arrives and speaks with the children. JJ takes him aside to talk about inheritance. it's awkward as it seems like JJ is only looking for money when it's not at all clear that their father is dead,
1. within dad's papers, patrick finds references to a dr. williams. he assumes he's an old colleague of dad's from Acme, but the dates don't make sense as they're much more recent. it seems like they've continued to work together. patrick attempts to contact williams, who quickly hangs up once patrick identifies himself.
1. patrick and amy track williams down and confront him outside of a coffee shop. williams is clearly terrified and tries to leave - tells them to drop it and stop looking into their father's research. he admits that he worked with their father, but was scared of him and of what he was working on, he told their dad he wanted out. redoubling their effort, they return to their father's research, certain now that they've missed something and that their father was onto something big.
1. [PAST] Scene about the stalling of the research and the shutting down of the project at Acme
1. meanwhile, CIA agents who have been watching Williams notice the call from John's house and the confrontation outside of the coffee shop and pick up Williams (this may all be off screen...)
1. john finds accounts that make no sense for their father - at least not the father he thought he had. john sr. had shell corporations upon shell corporations creating a vast network of interrelated entities - the type of thing john jr. was used to with the Kleiner account - his largest client, the one who was leaving him, and certainly one who was operating outside of the law. he asks patrick or amy if they have any idea why their dad's business would have the accounts without revealing the full extent of the mystery (e.g., businesses in the caymans, etc.). he has to step away when his wife calls from their home in LA. It's a tense conversation and he hides it from his siblings, but they notice he's unnerved when he returns.
1. Beau comes by with some clothes (?) for Amy. talks with everyone for a few minutes before abruptly announcing he's got to get back to the office - one of his projects is behind schedule and he needs to figure out how to fix it.
1. Over pizza at the dining table they grew up with, the siblings reminisce about their childhood, though very few of the memories are happy. the memories of their father are all brief snippets - he played an offstage role in their lives. the realization leads to talking about their mother who played such a different role - always a shoulder, always available. Amy, though she was the youngest, was always the most observant and noted that mother was more active than the brothers seemed to remember. she was often out of the home - whether for pta meetings or volunteering at the food shelter, etc. (their mother was actually in the CIA, and when the project John Sr., was working on stalled and it seemed like they'd never have a solution, the agency decided to extract her from the deep cover assignment through a fake death. she initially resisted the new assignment. after a decade + she'd forged a family and it would mean losing contact with her children (JJ now being 10, Patrick 8, and Amy 6) but ultimately acquiesced and was reassigned back to langley. -- readers do not know this)
1. [PAST] Mom dies, dad's life unravels
1. the next morning, john jr. is looking at more financial documents and notices their his father placed an ad in the local gazette several weeks previous (though he's always been a tribune man). they try to find the back issue online, but can't, so they call the paper to see which ad their dad placed. They find that the ad was a "help wanted ad" looking for a [Broadwood & Sons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Broadwood_%26_Sons) piano tuner. their father didn't play piano and didn't own one. the ad ended with a quote (what quote?). (possibility: while on the phone the ad seller asks them if their father ever found someone for a previous ad he'd placed - which leads to a conversation and discovery of _more_ ads, all ending with quotes.) The siblings decide to place the ad in the paper again.
1. the next morning, their dad's email gets a new message on an online community for piano enthusiasts. there's no chat history with the user, but the other person suggests meeting. patrick, at the keyboard, suggests the cafe - and taking his dad's cap and jacket goes. amy and jj join, sitting at a table across the aisle.
1. the person, mr. porter, from the online portal shows up and sits down at the table with patrick. as soon as Porter realizes it's not john sr. he makes to leave, but john jr. had scooted into the booth to keep him in. amy joining patrick on the other side. they talk. Porter turns out to have done some work for john sr., securing a package John had given him in a place that John wouldn't know the answer to as a type of safeguard. John had said he would contact Porter if it proved safe to do so so that he could retrieve the package. The ad the children placed served as that contact (though it wasn't the agreed upon protocol and he had been suspicious that something was wrong). while speaking with the children, Porter reveals that john sr. had grown nervous about what his work was yielding and suspicious of his partner. that's why he'd hired Porter - as a safeguard. Porter provides the kids with a key to a safety deposit box at First national.
1. [PAST] John sr. has second thoughts on whether or not the research should be finished - the technology, in the wrong hands, could wreak havoc on the world. williams urges him to reconsider, speaking of nobel prizes - getting upset when john resists. eventually john concedes to continue working on the project. (should probably talk about the progress they've made since leaving Acme - also, should be clear at this point that John is the brains)
1. the children go to the bank to open the safety deposit box. inside is a single small box and a lab notebook. the box is locked with a x-digit alphanumeric code (could be fun if it's the mom's name or something? or maybe something more mundane, like 'excelsior', the one phrase he'd always said, (but encrypted?) - depends on how it's revealed). all the children are now convinced something's very wrong and their dad isn't just missing (? were they not before? was jj only here to find money for his company to stop the bleeding?). they put all of the pieces they know on the table - the box, the clandestine meetings, the off shore accounts, the tension with the partner, williams' odd behavior - which now seems different than before - he no longer seems like a victim. amy calls Beau to tell her she won't be coming home again tonight. he says he's at the yard again anyway.
1. back at the house, patrick's trying to open the box. jj is looking over the documents to see what other clues he can find. amy's looking at the new lab notebook. amy finds an entry about the day's results and the eureka moment as well as her father's consternation that he may have just created pandora's box - he's terrified of what would happen if someone opened it. it's the last entry and is clearly written in a hurry - the last words are smudged as the book was closed before the ink had time to dry.
1. jj notices a suspicious consulting fee a week before john sr.'s disappearance. it was for to beau's firm and was authorized by williams.
1. john sr. is being held at beau's worksite. beau was hired by williams to kidnap john sr. and get him to reveal where he'd hidden the formula. williams is interrogating him. amy confronts williams. they scuffle and she's about to pin him down when beau comes in. williams is hurt and scuttles away while beau confronts amy and they fight. he's about to kill her when patrick and jj show up. beau is knocked over the head and falls into a cement pit (it's still wet / being mixed - if he's not pulled out, he'll drown / be part of the foundation). john sr. is freed and given some food and water.
1. patrick and john chase after williams who runs right into the parking lot as multiple cars with sirens and flashing lights show up. williams stops. out of the car steps their mother and a dozen field agents from the cia.
1. family reunited, box is opened by dad, password was mom's name. notebook with formula and vial (which was inside the box) are secured by the CIA. they'd been monitoring the situation since Patrick first reached out to Williams several days ago. that was the hint that work had continued and something had gone wrong.
